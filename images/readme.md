All new generated images appear in both `metadata-n`, and in the default `metadata` folder. The difference is:

- `metadata` has all the images, 
- I delete all images in `metadata-n` after I uploaded them to the kindle. So only new images appear there.

This way I donâ€™t have to upload all 2000 images to the kindle with every update.
