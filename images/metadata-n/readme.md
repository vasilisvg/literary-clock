All generated images appear in this folder as well, next to the default `metadata` folder. The difference is:

- `metadata` has all the images, 
- I delete all images in this folder after I uploaded them to the kindle. So only new images appear here.

This way I donâ€™t have to upload all 2000 images to the kindle with every update.
